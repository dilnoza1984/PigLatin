Create a method that takes a String and  converts each word to Pig latin. Pig Latin is a constructed language game in which words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules. In this exercise, convert the word by removing the first letter, placing the that letter at the end of the word, and then appending "ay" to the word. Here is an example:

English: I SLEPT MOST OF THE NIGHT
Pig Latin: IAY LEPTSAY OSTMAY FOAY HETAY IGHTNAY


  Examples: 
     
     Java is fun - > avaJay siay unfay
     How many languages do you speak -> owHay anymay anguageslay oday ouyay peaksay
